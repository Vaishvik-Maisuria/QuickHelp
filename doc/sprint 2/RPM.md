### Unfinished tasks:


As before, these tasks are accordingly represented in PivotalTracker. 

### Meeting Overview:

In this meeting, the QUickHealth team reflected on Sprint 1, and what went well and what didn't. The entire team was present for the meeting.

We realized that we over commited in sprint1, and assigned more user stories that we were able to complete. As we needed to focus on learning the new technologies and trying to figure out how to assign tasks effectively
This time, we agreed that we needed to focus on finishing user stories that we have already asigned in full before starting other user stories.

In our reflection, we identified several strengths of our developmental approach from sprint1 which we agreed to continue:
- Consistent votes and in depth conversations about implementation to ensure all members voices are heard and the best methadology is adapted
- Ensuring all team member shares the same coding environment and have all keys and urls required to collaborate on all environments
- Ensuring all members share the deadline by which they will complete their assigned tasks and verify when all tasks are completed
- Ensuring product maintains a consistent with the userInterface and don.md from sprint0

The main reason for our negative work experiences was due to the adaptation to new technology. The subgroups working on the account registration, profile setup and medical history form user stories was unable to implement MongoDB in time, so those user stories were not able to be implemented in time for sprint 1.
We also decided that members from different teams need to communicate and work together more as a lot of members were facing the same problems, and working together allows us to come up with a solution faster.

Our best experiences included the completion of Location Directions. It was motivating to be able to see the working results. The system architecture diagram was very helpful in understanding the technologies available to us and how they interact. Finally, finishing our initial CRC model provided us one of our best experiences in sprint 1 as well. After that was designed, our group envisioned our code base with a much greater clarity than before, and it was a fun experience coding with it on hand

### Release Goals and Plans 
1. For this release, we have selected to focus on the following user stories: 
	- SOS Signal 
	- Medical history form
	- Unique custom username 
	- Secure password 
	- Profile setup
	- Registration

2. The main focus will be finishing all user stories assigned in their individual branches, and combining them into one executable application on the main branch. This ensures that all members are fully aware how their feature interacts with the main application and solidifies their understanding of all user stories. Combing all user stories as soon as they are finished prevents all merging from being pushed to later sprints.

3. Our plan for this release is to implement the backend for basic authentication, and testing out the APIs we need to our core features working. The user should be able to go through the whole registration and sign in process with ease and security.


### Meeting Conclusion:
QUickHealths first SCRUM meeting was a successful gathering where our team members were able to find our bearings again. We noted our past mistakes and attempted to ensure we would not repeat them in the future. 

### SYSTEM DESIGN EXPLANATION:

Our System design Document underwent no changes. 
As the majority of this sprint was dedicated to finishing user stories picked in the previous sprint. 
Therefore, the previous design that was created was perfect and did not require any change. 
Also, this means that there were no changes made to the underlying project architecture. Instead, out development as mainly based on enacting the CRC's design of sprint 1. 
As we start to better integrate and combine features through the navigation bar, we assume we will change out system design, as group members have decided on possible new features and updates on a few features causing our CRC cards to be updated and certain characteristics of our DAO model to be upgraded to improve our code. For now, our objective remains to implement our original design idea within the MEAN framework.
