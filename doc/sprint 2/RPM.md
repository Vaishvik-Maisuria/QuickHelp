### Unfinished tasks:



As before, these tasks are accordingly represented in PivotalTracker. 



### Meeting Overview:

1. Our product owner was chosen to be Vaishvik Maisuria. The product owner states the purpose behind the project and described what his vision of the finish product will be. The team shared the product owner's enthusiasm.

2. All team members were able to attend the meeting.  

3. The product owner splits the team into sub teams to accomplish specific features. Team 1 includes Christine and Vaishvik. Team 2 includes Roshaan, Ainy, and Wen. Team 3 includes Parth and Ibrahim.

4. Team 1 was assigned to work on the release planning meeting and the feature which deals with finding the direction between two locations. This group is also responsible for editing and helping team 3 with system design.

5. Team 2 was assigned to work on user stories and maintaining Pivotal Tracker. They are responsible for correctly formulating user stories, recording all PB.md user stories on Pivotal Tracker, breaking down user stories into subtasks, allocating proper estimation of points and prioritizing user stories. They are also assigned to implement the user interface, and the routes for the medical history form. 

6. Team 3 was assigned to work on system design. They are also responsible for login and registration interface and to connect them to the server.

7. We have reviewed the definition of Done and have not added any new features. However, we have decided to break down a few features into smaller and less complex tasks as we anticipate that these features will take longer than expected. 

8. Discussions about technologies we need for the project were made. Team members who are more experienced with the technologies help other members gain a working knowledge of them so that they can begin on coding the features they have chosen to implement.

9. The team communicated clearly and effciently. We were able accomodate everyone's suggestions by allowing everyone to speak one-by-one and popular vote to resolve decisions. 


### Release Goals and Plans 
1. For this release, we have selected to focus on the following user stories: 
	- SOS Signal 
	- Medical history form
	- Unique custom username 
	- Secure password 
	- Profile setup

2. The main focus will be on laying out the first layer for the project. That is laying out the registeration form and profile page and combining it other core features. i.e ....

3. Our plan for this release is to set up the.......... , implement the backend for basic authentication, and testing out the APIs we need to get one of our core features working, i.e., 


### Meeting Conclusion:


### SYSTEM DESIGN EXPLANATION:


Our System design Document underwent no changes. As the majority of this sprint was dedicated to finishing user stories picked in the previous sprint. Therefore, the previous design that was created was perfect and did not require any change. Also, this means that there were no changes made to the underlying project architecture. Instead, out development as mainnly based on anactinf the CRC's design of sprint 1. As we start to better integreate and combine features through the navigation bar, we assume we will change out system design, as group member have decided on possible new features and updates ona few features causing out CRC cards to be updated and certain characteristics of out DAO model to be upgraded to improve out code. For now, our objective remains to implement our original design idea within the MEAN framework.
