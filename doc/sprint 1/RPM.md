### Meeting

1. Our product owner was chosen to be Vaishvik Maisuria. The product owner states the purpose behind the project and described what his vision of the finish product will be. The team shared the product owner's enthusiasm.

2. All team members were able to attend the meeting.  

3. The product owner splits the team into sub teams to accomplish specific features. Team 1 includes Christine and Vaishvik. Team 2 includes Roshaan, Ainy, and Wen. Team 3 includes Parth and Ibrahim.

4. Team 1 was assigned to work on the release planning meeting and the feature which deals with finding the direction between two locations. This group is also responsible for editing and helping team 3 with system design.

5. Team 2 was assigned to work on user stories and maintaining Pivotal Tracker. They are responsible for correctly formulating user stories, recording all PB.md user stories on Pivotal Tracker, breaking down user stories into subtasks, allocating proper estimation of points and prioritizing user stories. They are also assigned to implement the user interface, and the routes for the medical history form. 

6. Team 3 was assigned to work on system design. They are also responsible for login and registration interface and to connect them to the server.

7. We have reviewed the definition of Done and have not added any new features. However, we have decided to break down a few features into smaller and less complex tasks as we anticipate that these features will take longer than expected. 

8. Discussions about technologies we need for the project were made. Team members who are more experienced with the technologies help other members gain a working knowledge of them so that they can begin on coding the features they have chosen to implement.

9. The team communicated clearly and effciently. We were able accomodate everyone's suggestions by allowing everyone to speak one-by-one and popular vote to resolve decisions. 


### Release Goals and Plans 

1. For this release, we have selected to focus on the following user stories: 
	- Location directions
	- Medical history form
	- Unique custom username 
	- Secure password 
	- Profile setup

2. The main focus will be on laying out the foundations for the project. That is laying out the foundation for the backend, and testing out the technologies we will be using in the project. This includes making sure all team members have a working knowledge of the technologies we will be working with, which includes Android Studio, Node/Express, MongoDB, and Google's APIs.  

3. Our plan for this release is to set up the Node/Express server, design MongoDB schemas for our user data, create the API route to handle updates to user's medical history form and implement the UI of it, implement the backend for basic authentication, and testing out the APIs we need to get one of our core features working, i.e., allowing a skilled professional be able to locate where the patient is. This will be done by attempting to use Google Direction API to draw a polyline between a skilled professional's location and the patient's location and display it on a Google Map.
