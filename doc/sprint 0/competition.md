The whole idea to save a personâ€™s life with a push of a button is unique on its own. 
We are designing a mobile application which allows certified doctors, practitioners and 
CPR certified induvials in the vicinity to come aid an injured or dying person in times 
of extreme severity before even the ambulance gets there. Data collected from 300 trauma 
centers found that of the gunshot victims who came to the E.R via ambulance, 19.3% died 
of their injuries. In this way, a faster solution was needed and that is how the idea of 
this application was formed to lessen and prevent the person from dying all together if 
there was a doctor in the area that can help you immediately. As for the doctors, this 
application not only allows them for the incentive to make a few extra dollars on the side, 
but it allows them to also make a difference in the community.
