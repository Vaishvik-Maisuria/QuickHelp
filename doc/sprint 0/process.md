#### Process for Phase One
The group meets in-person at least twice a week for at least 2 hours to discuss individual progress and make big decisions on issues that affect multiple members of the group and their work for phase one. The main form of communication we use to arrange meetings, discuss about untouched ideas/features, and future plans was via facebook messenger. We used facebook messenger poll to make general decisions and then meet in person to have further discuss and finalize the direction of the project. 

Prior to our first meeting, we collectively agreed to create a Google Doc where each team member could write a brief proposal on any ideas they might have. Taking the project to the next stage, we held our first meeting where we presented our ideas to the rest of the team, and finally came to a general concensus on the project idea. One team member proposed an idea that was based on services that combined attributes of Uber and ambulance service. As a group we collectively contributed to the idea, proposing potential features and services to improve on the application. 

When a decision must be made, a team meeting will be held to address the issue. During the team meeting, the team (as a whole) must first acknowledge that a problem exists and that a decision needs to be made. Our team together maps out objectives and issues at hand and collectively try to come up with solutions and steps to move the project forward. We go through a brainstorming process where we try to view the problem from different angles and discuss pros and cons potential solution. Finally, we pick a solution on consensus and create a iterative process to execute it.  

Our priority and points were heavily inspired by the CoS model. A team member placed each user story on 3x5 sized index cards. We then had a vote to determine the complexity using the Fibonacci scale and numbered the back of each card accordingly. Next, we ordered the cards in descending order and discussed the results. In order to finalize the priority of the user stories, we used the Scrum Poker Cards (Agile) application to help us conclude the decision as a group. It took an average of 2 rounds of voting for a consensus for the point estimates.

Throughout this process we were able to pin point a list of impediments that, moving forward, we aim acknowledge for a more efficient sprint cycle. Firstly, it was difficult trying to get around everyone’s schedule to find a time when everyone could meet. For the next phase, we've decided to use www.when2meet.com every Sunday night to get an idea of what everyone’s availability for the week is like and plan our meetings accordingly. Secondly, we found that unorganized discussion can lead to a chaotic environment that can lower the group morale. We agreed on a process where each team member, one by one, gets a chance to share their thoughts and opinion while the rest of the team actively listens.
