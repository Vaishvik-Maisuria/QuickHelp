how did your team make decisions?

When a decision must be made, a team meeting will be held to address the issue. During the team meeting, the team (as a whole) must first recognize that a problem exists and a decision needs to be made. Then, our team together maps the issue at hand including stating when, how and where memeber(s) became aware of the problem, find different ways to view the problem and to challenge assumptions (if any) made about the problem. Once mapped, the team takes time brainstorming and noting down potential solutions to the issue. After, we as a team go through the potential solutions and talk about the advantages and disadvantages of each one. The team then votes on each solution in which the majority will decide. 

Did you meet in person or online?

We use facebook messenger poll to make general decisions and then meet in person to have further discussions to finalize the direction the project should go. Group meetings were also held to make constructive feedbacks on each members’ work and gather inputs from the team. 

How frequently did you meet? 
Member of the group are constantly asking and discussing project material on the facebook chat as individuals make progress. But, the group meets in-person at least twice a week for at least a hour to notify the group on individual progress and make big decisions on issues that affect multiple members of the group and their work.

What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
It was difficult trying get around everyone’s schedule to find a time when everyone could meet. For the next phase, we agree to use www.when2meet.com every Sunday night to get a glimpse of everyone’s availability for the week.

We also found setting up polls to vote on general decisions very effective. We plan to take facebook messenger poll forward to the next phase.

We found that unorganized arguing can lead to a chaotic environment that can lower the group morale. We agreed on a process where each team member, one by one,  gets a chance to share their thoughts and opinion while the rest of the team stays silent for the time being. 

How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?

Priority and points for user stories for our team were heavily inspired by the CoS model

How my team defined our priority and points was heavily inspired by the CoS model. One team member put each user story in  3x5 sized index cards. We then had a vote to determine the complexity using the Fibonacci scale and numbered the back of each card accordingly. After, we ordered the cards from decreasing order and discussed our results. In order to finalize the priority of the user stories, we used the “app suggested by prof”  to help us come to a decision as a group. It took an average of 2 rounds of voting for a consensus for the point estimate.
