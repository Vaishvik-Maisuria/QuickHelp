Betty is a 15 year old girl living in a highly urbanized city with her 75 year old grandmother, Elizabeth. They live in an 18 storey condominium in a posh neighbourhood. Betty is a freshmen at the St. Josephs Highschool where she is enrolled in the IB program to fast track her education career. Concerned, yet motivated, due to her grandmother's uncertain health, Betty is planning to pursue medicine at the city's most reputable school. Never the less, she is still taking courses from all major streams, namely technology and law.

Betty loves to spend time chatting and helping out her grandmother. Once every week, Betty bakes an apple pie with Elizabeth to serve for her cousins visiting every sunday. Every once in a while Betty likes to change up the refreshment for the sunday visitors. She mostly gets her new exclusive ideas from cooking pages she follows on instagram or a newly uploaded video she gets notified on a cooking channel. 

Betty, similar to the rest of generation z, is an avid technology user. She surfes the internet for any doubts she possesses and is convinced of the safety and accuracy of the inputted and outputted data. From her grandmothers occasionally arising pain to the reason behind her favourite celebrity's divorce, she believes internet has all the answers.
