An Android/Web app that tells you who is the closest human that can perform
CPR or other medical procedure, someone closer than the doctors. For example, if my friend got hit with a car and we need someone to perform first aid or some sort of medical operation and the ambulance is far away from the patient, the friend can request for
assistance on the app which will find the closest doctor (if registered on the app). Then, the doctor can accept if they have time to save my friend or at least help out, they can also use the app to reach the patient.

Purpose: To save lives!

Usage: Any individual in society can use it as long as they have a phone.
