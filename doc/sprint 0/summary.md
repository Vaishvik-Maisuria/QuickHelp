# Scenarios

### Scenario 1

My friend is choking at a restaurant and we need someone to perform CPR and the ambulance is too far away. I requested for assistance using QuickHealth which finds the closest person with CPR training (if they are registered on the app). John, who has CPR training, receives a request where he can accept/decline if he has the time to save my friend or at least help out. He can also use the app's navigation feature to get detail location and how to get to my friend.

### Scenario 2 

I was leaving UTM after a late night study session in the library. As I walking down the stairs to go to the parking lot, I tumbled down the stairs and dislocated my arm and I started bleeding everywhere. There is no one around to help, so I decided to use QuickHealth. The app was able to alert for an ambulance and also provide tips and instructions on what I could do to reduce the bleeding, while I wait for the ambulance to come. 

### Scenario 3

My friend and I were walking down through the park at midnight and some person came and threatened us with a knife. We gave our belongings to him but the robber still attacked my friend. He stabbed my friend on the shoulder, and left him bleeding. It was late night, so we decided to use the app to contact any skilled doctors in the area. Dr. Brown, received an alert that woke him up. The alert descibed the location, and type of injury. He figured he could help, so he made his way to us and helped slow the bleeding until the ambulence arrived.
