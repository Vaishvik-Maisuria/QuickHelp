Overall, QuickHelp was a success for the QuickHealth team. We had both happy and stressful periods of agony with the development period of the project. Therefore, our team managed to produce a product that exceeded the expectation of the group and could potentially revolutionize the country's Health System.

Some __successful tools, techniques and conventions__ that were employed the duration of the semester included "total communicatoin" and "subgrouping". Subgrouping was a successful technique that we used, where we would divide assign subgroups of the team to complete a specific user story by breaking it into managing specific tasks. This in turn also allowed for better communiaction as it was easier for sub groups to communicate amongst themselves than with the whole group. This also allowd for pair programming, which was a technique that we employed that led to efficient coding and almost-real-time bug fixes.

We encountered most of our __problematic tools, techniques and conventions__ in the beginning of the project. This is because all members were learning MEAN teachniques and technologies, and were unfamiliar with the project environment. Many of us would install modules and packages which others did not have, and this led to confusions with what resources each of us had and what was required. Required technologies like PivotalTracker and Github also posed a learning problem. Some members did not feel comfortable working on these platfroms which lead to communication problems with the rest of the group. However, members took time to make sure unfamiliar members knew what they needed to do, and we were able to utilize the technology's full potential and it became a powerful tool for us to keep our subgroups on track.

Were we to continue working as this team, our __ideal process__ would look like what we had in the final Sprint. We would continue regularly meeting in person to code, employ pair programming at every turn, and ensure the unification of our coding environment. Our process in the final Sprint was with little error, as we reached peak productivity that we possibly could have as a group.
