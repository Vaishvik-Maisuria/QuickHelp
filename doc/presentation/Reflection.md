Overall, QuickHelp was a success for the QuickHealth team. We had both happy and stressful periods of agony with the development period of the project. Therefore, our team managed to produce a product that exceeded the expectation of the group and could potentially revolutionize the countries Health System.

Subgrouping was another successful technique we used, where we would divide coders of a specific story into managing specific tasks- this led to greatly accelerated individual and pair programming. On that note, pair programming was another successful technique that we used that led to efficient coding and almost-real-time bug fixes. Finally, we also established uniform variable naming syntax so we could all easily format our code.

The core of all our __problematic conventions/techniques/tools was isolation__. The worst of these appeared early in the project, when we were all learning MEAN as individuals instead of a single unit. Many of us would install modules and packages which others did not have, and this led to merging conflicts and unfamiliarity with what resources each of us had. The words "I'm going to push" were met with distress from the team, as we knew our visualization of the code was about to change. Furthermore, prior to establishing pair programming and total communication, syntax checking and error management was individual- leading to errors which would snag coders for hours on end (such as the aforementioned environment error).

Interestingly, we also had some issues with PivotalTracker and Github. The interface was confusing at first and we often took to ignoring it. However, we realized the technology's full potential towards the end and it became a powerful tool for us to keep our subgroups on track.

Were we to continue working as this team, our __ideal process__ would look like what we had in the final Sprint. We would continue regularly meeting in person to code, employ pair programming at every turn, and ensure the unification of our coding environment. Our process in the final Sprint was with little error, as we reached peak productivity that we possibly could have as a group. However, we want to ensure that we adhere to this process from the first Sprint, so we can actually sleep next time.
