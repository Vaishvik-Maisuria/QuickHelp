### Unfinished tasks:


As before, these tasks are accordingly represented in PivotalTracker. 

### Meeting Overview:

In this meeting, the QuickHealth team reflected on Sprint 1, and what went well and what didn't. The entire team was present for the meeting (from March 11, 2019, 4:00PM - 6:00 PM).

After successfully meeting our goals in the previoius sprint, our team is motivated to continue developing the app at a rapid pace. For this particular sprint, all of our members had obligations for other courses, so our workloads were heavier than usual. Therefore, each of our members assigned just enough user stories that we could handle to ensure that our work is completed by the end of the sprint. Leveraging what we've learned from completing previous user stories, our team continued to build more features.

Although sprint 2 was particularly rough due to tight schedules we have for our other courses, this sprint has provided us with the most significant highlights of the project so far. We were able to meet sprint goals even under situations of high stress, and gain insight what it truly means to work in a team. We learned to comfortably assign tasks to members that we know are capable of completing them, and follow through with the task. Therefore, our team is ready is tackle all essential features of the app in the upcoming sprints.

### Release Goals and Plans 
1. For this release, we have selected to focus on the following user stories: 
	- navigation bar
	- medical form
	- personal information page
	- emergency contact page
	- sign out

2. The main focus will be to finish all user stories assigned in each subteam's individual branches, and combine them into one executable application on the main branch. This ensures that all members are fully aware of how their feature interacts with the main application and solidifies their understanding of all user stories. Merging completed user stories as soon as possible will allow us to resolve any merge conflicts early on in the development process instead of pushing it into later sprints.

3. Our plan for this release is to ensure that all assigned user stories add functional value to the product by the end of the sprint


### Meeting Conclusion:
Quick Health's third SCRUM meeting was a successful gathering where our team members continued to work together successfully to ensure improvements are being made to the product.

### SYSTEM DESIGN EXPLANATION:

Our System design Document underwent no changes. 
As the majority of this sprint was dedicated to finishing user stories picked in the previous sprint. Therefore, the previous design that was created was perfect and did not require any change. Also, this means that there were no changes made to the underlying project architecture. Instead, our development was mainly based on enacting the CRC's design of sprint 1. 
As we start to better integrate and combine features through the navigation bar, we assume we will change our system design, as group members have decided on possible new features and updates on a few features causing our CRC cards to be updated and certain characteristics of our DAO model to be upgraded to improve our code. For now, our objective remains to implement our original design idea using the techincal stack we intend to use which was Android Studio, MongoDB, Express, and Node.
