### Meeting Overview:

In this meeting, the QuickHealth team reflected on Sprint 3, and what went well and what didn't. The entire team was present for the meeting (from March 21, 2019, 4:00PM - 6:00 PM).

After successfully meeting our goals in the previous sprint, our team is motivated to continue developing the app at a rapid pace. As the team realizes that we are nearing the end of the semester, all members are motivated to complete as much as possible in this sprint. This sprint consisted mainly on implementing the details of the major features of the project. Our members continue to build on features related to the user stories they've been implementing in previous sprints. This way members can work with what they are most familiar with and have more extensive knowledge about. 

As sprint 4 was the most productive among all previous sprints, this sprint has provided us with the most significant highlights of the project so far. We were able to meet and surpass sprint goals, applying our learning from previous sprints. Not only were we able to comfortably assign tasks to members that we know are capable of completing them, and follow through with the assigned tasks, members that felt confident in the tasks assigned and were able to complete them early rose up to the task, tackling other related items and helping their colleagues. Therefore, our team is ready to tackle all remaining features of the app for the rest of the semester. 

### Release Goals and Plans 
1. For this release, we have selected to focus on the following user stories: 
	- 911 emergency call button
	- Forgot password
	- Upload Documents Functionality
	- Doctor verification
	- SOS cancel
	- Accept/dismis option
	- Emergency Contact
	- Update Injury Type
	- Add Profile Picture
	- Patient Self Help
	- Chat

2. The main focus will be to finish all user stories assigned in each subteam's individual branches, and combine them into one executable application on the master branch. This ensures that all members are fully aware of how their feature interacts with the main application and solidifies their understanding of all user stories. Merging completed user stories as soon as possible will allow us to resolve any merge conflicts early on in the development process instead of pushing it into later sprints. 

3. Our plan for this release is to ensure that all assigned user stories add functional value to the product by the end of the sprint. We aim to have a nearly finished product, leaving only minor bug fixes for the final sprint.


### Meeting Conclusion:
Quick Health's fourth SCRUM meeting was a successful gathering where our team members continued to work together successfully to ensure improvements are being made to the product.

### SYSTEM DESIGN EXPLANATION:

Our System design document underwent a change. We got rid of the Professional class because there was no significant difference between the User and Professional classes. Since the majority of the implementation in this sprint was on bringing togther components that were previously implemented, we had to get rid of any classes that were no longer needed or in practise had no real purpose.
As we approach our final product we are beginning to reflect upon some of the design decisions we initially made. Furthermore, we expect this sprint to be the final sprint in terms of any changes to the initial design decisions. For now, our objective remains to implement our original design idea using the techincal stack we intend to use which was Android Studio, MongoDB, Express, and Node.
